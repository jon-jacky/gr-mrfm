<p>
I recently learned Verilog to program an FPGA with digital filters for a
<a href="index.html">project</a>
(also
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2005-01/msg00232.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.research.cornell.edu/KIC/events/MRFM2006/pdfs/Jacky%20talk/jacky-talk.html">here</a>).

<p>
There are important differences between Verilog (or any hardware
description language) and conventional (software only) programming:

<ul>

<li>Distinction between simulation and synthesis, with different
programming styles and tool chains for each.

<li>Distinction between structural and behavioral code --- but the same
functionality can be expressed either way.

<li>Parallel execution at the module, block, and statement level.

</ul>

<p>
I use 
<a href="http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog/">Icarus</a> 
and 
<a href="http://home.nc.rr.com/gtkwave/">GTKWave</a> 
for simulation, 
<a href="https://www.altera.com/support/software/download/altera_design/quartus_we/dnl-quartus_we.jsp">Quartus</a> 
for synthesis.

<p>
In embedded systems, the advantage of using FPGAs and Verilog (or any
programmable hardware and HDL), rather than a conventional processor
and programming language, is parallelism and simplicity.  With FPGAs
and Verilog you can always add more functions in parallel with no
penalty in speed or complexity: just use more modules, more pins, and
(if needed) more (or bigger) FPGA chips.  All modules run in parallel
at full speed; their execution does not share a single processor; it
is true concurrency, not interleaving concurrency as on one or a few
processors.  There is no need for any processes or threads, nor any
need to synchronize among them, nor any need for an operating system at all.

<p>
The biggest difference from conventional programming is not the
language, but the development method.  We have only very limited
ability to observe and debug synthesized Verilog code, compared to a
conventional program.  We must do most debugging in simulation.
Simulation requires a testbed that simulates the input signals.  The
usual way to obtain this is to also write it in Verilog. But simulation may
not be conclusive; the same code can behave differently in simulation
than when synthesized, due to limitations in the testbed and quirks in
the tools.

<p>
There don't seem to be any classic books 
(<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/1ae7c4b7af0603ff?hl=en">like K&R for C</a>)
so the beginning Verilog programmer has to build on understanding
gained from previous experience.  Two kinds are needed.

<p>
Software experience helps us understand:

<ul>

<li>Behavioral code.  Here Verilog is similar to most programming
languages, except for the parallelism.  Verilog syntax is similar to
C.  For example, see this mostly 
<a
href="http://gnuradio.org/trac/browser/gnuradio/trunk/usrp/fpga/toplevel/mrfm/biquad_2stage.v">behavioral
code</a>


<li>Binding. Verilog binding of wires to ports is similar to the
binding of arguments to parameters in a conventional programming language.

<li>Instances. Verilog modules and instances are similar
to classes and instances in object-oriented programming.  
Multiple instances of the same Verilog module can exist at the same
time.

</ul>

Hardware experience helps us understand:

<ul>
<li>Structural code.  Here Verilog is a textual representaton of
a circuit diagram, including the parallelism.  Each Verilog module
describes a kind of circuit, each instance of a module is another distinct
example of that circuit (that occupies actual real estate in the
device when synthesized). For example, compare this 
<a
href="http://gnuradio.org/trac/browser/gnuradio/trunk/usrp/fpga/toplevel/mrfm/mrfm_proc.v">structural code</a> 
to the block diagram labeled <em>Heterodyne control</em> on this
<a href="http://www.research.cornell.edu/KIC/events/MRFM2006/pdfs/Jacky%20talk/jacky-talk.html">page</a>.

<li>Combinational logic and data flow.  Verilog continuous assigment
to wires.

<li>Clocked logic and synchronization.  Verilog procedural assignment
to registers.

</ul>

<p>
My impression is that, instead of books, experienced Verilog programmers mostly refer to 
<a
href="http://gnuradio.org/trac/browser/gnuradio/trunk/usrp/fpga/toplevel/mrfm/mrfm_proc.v">examples</a> 
(<a
