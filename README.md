gr-mrfm
=======

Web site for the Clinical Neutron Therapy System, a computer-controlled
radiation therapy machine.

This web site was made by Jonathan Jacky at the University of Washington
around 2009.   It is archived here for historic interest.

The index.html web page and other files in the gr-mrfm/www/ subdirectory were
the http://staff.washington.edu/jon/gr-mrfm/ web site.  The other gr-mrfm
subdirectories were in the gr-mrfm.tar archive at that web site.

This is a web site, so all of the content is in the gh-pages branch.
